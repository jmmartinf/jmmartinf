### Hi there ğŸ‘‹,

I'm a R enthusiasm... In Github I share (in private mode) code with my students and customers, however I'd love to colaborate in analysis related to the tourism industry.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Time Series about passengers, turists and vsitors that is interest to stablish prices in the tourism industry.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on A/B analysis, ARIMA models, GAM a any regressive models, Bootstraping resampling...
- ğŸ™Œ Any kind of Dataset or Repository it is wellcome.
